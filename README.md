To get the usage for each script, run

    name_of_script.py -h

in a command prompt. Python 3.x must be installed.

NOTES
-----

`add_docs.py` has a few issues:

 - It may fail to insert some headers if it doesn't recognize the code
   formatting in the source file for the specific function/class opening line
   thing (whatever that's called).
 - It sometimes adds extra stuff to the calls/called by fields.
 - When parsing a function or class's code block, it counts the opening and
   close braces to know when to stop. It can be messed up if there are braces
   in comments or strings. So don't do that.

The first two problems can be fixed by tightening up the regular expressions.

The example files were generated by the following commands:

    list_driver.exe > driver_output.txt
    parse_test.py driver_output.txt parse_test_output.txt
    format_plan.py parse_test_output.txt format_plan_output.html

The output from `parse_test.py` can be edited if needed to make adjustments
to the final test plan.
